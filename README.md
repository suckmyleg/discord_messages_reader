# Why
Project started because i was bored and discord told me that my account data was done so I started developing a python object that reads index.json and displays chats data.

In the first menu you can write: 
  m to display more chats
  a to display chats from the beggining
  *number* to display info and messages from the chat
  

# Important

The code is simple and it took me 30m, Im uploading this so lazy people can download it so they dont spend any minute doing this.
Anyway the code sucks and it doesnt show all the messages, Im going to save this without fixing it because I want to play Overwatch right now so if you find the error or you want to contribute, do a pull request or recreate the project. gl
